> Update: This project now supports `v6` of redux-form. Details are here: /blog/redux-form-v6-dropzone-example/

After seeing a [few](https://github.com/erikras/redux-form/issues/71#issuecomment-161063527) [requests](https://github.com/erikras/redux-form/issues/71#issuecomment-155882501) [for](https://github.com/erikras/redux-form/issues/71#issuecomment-172674992) an example of [ react dropzone](https://github.com/okonet/react-dropzone) and [redux-form](https://github.com/erikras/redux-form). I decided to create one to show how you can integrate a drag & drop component with your redux app.

It's here on github [dropzone-redux-form-example](https://github.com/BBB/dropzone-redux-form-example), any improvements would be gratefully recieved.

##### Sidenote
It was made super easy to setup this example with [nwb](https://github.com/insin/nwb) (Especially with the new `--auto-install`  flag). It's great to see that the tooling within the react community starting to mature!
